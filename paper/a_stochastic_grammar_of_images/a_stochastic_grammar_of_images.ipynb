    "### Objectives\n",
    "Given an input image, the image parsing task constructs a most probable parse graph on-the-fly as the output interpretation and this parse graph is a subgraph of the And-Or graph (AOG) after making choices on the Or-nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objectives:\n",
    "1. a common framework (that is AOG) for visual knowledge representation and object categorization\n",
    "2. scalable and recursive top-down/bottom-up computation\n",
    "3. small sample learning and generalization\n",
    "4. mapping the visual vocabulary to fill the [semantic gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_gap) between symbols and pixels\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational procedure:\n",
    "1. bottom-up detecting and binding using a cascade of features\n",
    "2. top-down on-line template composition and matching.\n",

    "Figure 2: Illustrating the recursive bottom-up / top-down computation processure in image parsing. The detection of rectangles (in red) instantiates some non-terminal nodes shown as upward arrows. They in turn activate graph grammar rules for grouping larger structures in nodes A, B, C respectively. These rules generate top-down prediction of rectangles (in blue). The redictions are validated from the image under the Bayesian posterior probability.\n",
