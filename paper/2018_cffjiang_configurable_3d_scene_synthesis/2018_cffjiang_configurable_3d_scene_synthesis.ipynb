    "Figure 1: (a) An example automatically-generated 3D bedroom scene, rendered as a photorealistic RGB image, along with its (b) per-pixel ground truth (from top) surface normal, depth, and object identity images. (c) Another synthesized bedroom scene. Synthesized scenes include fine details—objects (e.g., duvet and pillows on beds) and their textures are changeable, by sampling the physical parameters of materials (reflectance, roughness, glossiness, etc..), and illumination parameters are sampled from continuous spaces of possible positions, intensities, and colors. (d)–(g) Rendered images of four other example synthetic indoor scenes—(d) bedroom, (e) bathroom, (f) study, (g) gym.\n",
